## Description

This project is a real-time volumetric simulation editor. It is inspired by [EmberGen](https://jangafx.com/software/embergen/). It is realized for one of the courses of the Imaging Science Master's degree at the Gustave Eiffel University.

This is a C++ project made thanks to Qt Quick 2 and OpenGL.
